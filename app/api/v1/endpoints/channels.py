# For actual integration (e.g., SMS Gateway, Email Services, Voice Assistant APIs), you would replace the placeholder logic in channels.py with real integrations. Here's a simplified overview:

# SMS Gateway (e.g., Twilio, Nexmo): Use their SDK or API to send/receive messages.
# Email Service (e.g., AWS SES, SendGrid): Integrate with their API for sending emails.
# Voice Assistant (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant): Connect via Alexa Skills API or Google Assistant SDK.
